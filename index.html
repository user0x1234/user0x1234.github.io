<!-- ======================= INTRODUCTION ======================= -->
<section class="intro-section">
  <h2>“Statistics is the grammar of science”</h2>
  <p class="quote-author">— Karl Pearson</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Statistics is, or should be, about scientific investigation and how to do it better, 
    but many statisticians believe it is a branch of mathematics. Now I agree that the physicist, 
    the chemist, the engineer, and the statistician can never know too much mathematics, but their 
    objectives should be better physics, better chemistry, better engineering, and in the case of 
    statistics, better scientific investigation.”  
    <br><em>— George E. P. Box</em>
