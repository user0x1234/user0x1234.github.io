In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is the mathematical function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment.[1][2] It is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events (subsets of the sample space).[3]
<br />
A probability distribution is a mathematical description of the probabilities of events, subsets of the sample space. The sample space, often denoted by Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } \Omega , is the set of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon being observed; it may be any set: a set of real numbers, a set of vectors, a set of arbitrary non-numerical values, etc. For example, the sample space of a coin flip would be Ω = {heads, tails}. 

<br />
In statistics, a univariate distribution is a probability distribution of only one random variable. This is in contrast to a multivariate distribution, the probability distribution of a random vector (consisting of multiple random variables). 
<br />
## Univariate and multivariate distribution
One of the simplest examples of a discrete univariate distribution is the discrete uniform distribution, where all elements of a finite set are equally likely. It is the probability model for the outcomes of tossing a fair coin, rolling a fair die, etc. The univariate continuous uniform distribution on an interval [a, b] has the property that all sub-intervals of the same length are equally likely.

Given two random variables that are defined on the same probability space,[1] the joint probability distribution is the corresponding probability distribution on all possible pairs of outputs. The joint distribution can just as well be considered for any given number of random variables. The joint distribution encodes the marginal distributions, i.e. the distributions of each of the individual random variables. It also encodes the conditional probability distributions, which deal with how the outputs of one random variable are distributed when given information on the outputs of the other random variable(s).

## What Are Marginal and Conditional Distributions?

In statistics, a probability distribution is a mathematical generalization of a function that describes the likelihood for an event to occur. Mathematically, the events are assigned to random variables, and the distribution can be used to calculate the likelihood that such a variable lies in a given range. Probability distributions are often represented in their mathematical form, p(x)
, where the variable x

represents the set of all possible outcomes or events.

Among the probability distributions that can be computed regarding random variables are both marginal and conditional distributions. A definition that will be useful to understand the concepts of marginal and conditional probability is that of joint probability. The joint probability is a distribution that represents the likelihood of two events occurring simultaneously. The joint probability of two possible events can be described with a distribution of the form p(x,y)
. This concept can be generalized to the joint probability of K arbitrary events p(z1,…,zK)


The marginal probability of an event is the probability distribution that describes only the subset of the event of interest, that is, a reduction of a general joint probability distribution so that it depends on a single event. For simplicity, when considering the case of a joint probability distribution that depends on two possible events, x
and y the marginal probability would correspond in this case to a function px(x), where the variable related to the event y

has been integrated out.

The conditional probability, on the other hand, is a distribution that represents the likelihood of an event to occur given a particular outcome of another event. It is usually represented as

p(x|y)

A particularly useful result that relates the joint probability of two variables with the conditional probability is Bayes' theorem:<br />

p(x|y)=p(x,y)p(y)

## Difference Between Marginal and Conditional Distributions

There are a few differences between the marginal and conditional distributions. To begin with, they describe different likelihoods. The marginal distribution describes the likelihood of an event to occur, independent of others, while the conditional distribution describes the likelihood of an event to occur given the outcome of another. As such, the marginal distribution is a function of only one variable, while the conditional distribution is a function of at least two, the event of interest and the event, or events, it is conditional on.

## Definition of the CSV Format 

   While there are various specifications and implementations for the
   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there is no formal
   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety of
   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that
   seems to be followed by most implementations:

   1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
       break (CRLF).  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
       break.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   3.  There maybe an optional header line appearing as the first line
       of the file with the same format as normal record lines.  This
       header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
       and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the header line
       should be indicated via the optional "header" parameter of this
       MIME type).  For example:

       field_name,field_name,field_name CRLF
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF

   4.  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
       fields, separated by commas.  Each line should contain the same
       number of fields throughout the file.  Spaces are considered part
       of a field and should not be ignored.  The last field in the
       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:

       aaa,bbb,ccc

   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes (however
       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes
       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then
       double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:

       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx

   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.  For example:

       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"
