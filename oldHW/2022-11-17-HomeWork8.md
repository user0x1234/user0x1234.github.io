## Researches about pure theory (T)
T17. Search on the web about possible derivation of the Normal Distribution.
T18. Search on the web about method to generate normal variate (eg Marsaglia method, etc.) 


## Researches about applications (A)
A12. Consider R (radius), A(angle) uniform rv's and use them as random polar coordinates on a plane.
Determine the empirical distribution of the corresponding Cartesian coordinates (X,Y).

A13. Search for the methods to generate Normal rv's X from uniform rv's, and simulate the following distribution: X, X², X/Y², X²/Y², X/Y .

## Researches about theory relevant to applications (TA)

TA7. Find in the web what are the distributions that you just simulated.
