			<p>Hi Everyone,

Hi everyone!
My name is User0x1234, and I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Rome Tor Vergata.

I created this blog as part of the Statistics course, with the goal of documenting my learning process and exploring key topics in probability, stochastic processes, and their applications. While the primary objective is to successfully pass the exam, this space also serves as a way to deepen my understanding and connect theory with practical examples, especially from a computational perspective.

Through notes, exercises, and small experiments, I hope this blog can reflect both my academic progress and my interest in applying statistical reasoning to real-world problems.

Thanks for reading, and welcome!
