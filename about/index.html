			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi Everyone,

My name is User0x1234,  and I’m a recent computer science graduate from Tor Vergata. I am writing to formally introduce myself and share a little bit about the work I’ll be doing here.  I've created this blog for the Statistics course with the hope of learning new topics, but with the aim of passing the exam</p>
