# Statistics
Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.[1][2][3] In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.[4] 

Mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics. Mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure-theoretic probability theory.[5][6]

Mathematical statistics is the application of probability theory, a branch of mathematics, to statistics, as opposed to techniques for collecting statistical data. Specific mathematical techniques which are used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure theory.[7][8]

## Methods 

Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).[5] Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.

## What is a dataset? 

A data set (or dataset) is a collection of data. In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every column of a table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given record of the data set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as for example height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set. Data sets can also consist of a collection of documents or files.[1]

Several characteristics define a data set's structure and properties. These include the number and types of the attributes or variables, and various statistical measures applicable to them, such as standard deviation and kurtosis.

In science and research, an attribute is a quality of an object (person, thing, etc.).[1] Attributes are closely related to variables. A variable is a logical set of attributes.[1] Variables can "vary" â€“ for example, be high or low.

## Find and list interesting application of Statistics to Cybersecurity problems

The statistical cyber-security group are developing data science techniques that enable large dynamic computer networks to identify intrusions and anomalous behaviour and therefore protect against cyber-attacks and fraudulent activity. Using statistical methodology, machine learning and Big Data analytics the group develop tools to perform scalable anomaly detection in high volume data streams such as social networks, telecoms networks, network flow data, host-based sensor process-level data, cyber-physical and IoT data, pinpointing deviations from normal behaviour.

## Create the project Visual Basic Project

When you create an application in Visual Studio, you first create a project and a solution. For this example, you'll create a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) project.
 - Open Visual Studio.
 - On the Create a new project window, choose the Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) template for Visual Basic.

## Create the application

After you select your Visual Basic project template and name your file, Visual Studio opens a form for you. A form is a Windows user interface.

### Add a button to the form

-  Click Toolbox to open the Toolbox fly-out window.
-  Click the Button control and then drag it onto the form.
-  In the Appearance section (or the Fonts section) of the Properties window, type Click this, and then press Enter

### Add a richtextbox to the form

Now that we've added a button control to create an action, let's add a richtextbox control to send text to.

- Select the richtextbox control from the Toolbox window, and then drag it onto the form and drop it.
- In either the Design section or the (DataBindings) section of the Properties window, change the name of richTextForm1 to rTFHelloWorld, and then press Enter.

### Add code to the form

- In the Form1.vb [Design] window, double-click the Click this button to open the Form1.vb window. (Alternatively, you can expand Form1.vb in Solution Explorer, and then click Form1.)
- In the Form1.vb window, between the Private Sub and End Sub lines, type or enter richTextForm1.Text = "Hello World!" as shown in the following screenshot:

### Run the application

- Click the Start button to run the application.
- Click Start to debug and run the app
