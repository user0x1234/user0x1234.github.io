## Poisson Arrival / Jump Process (Memoryless) Simulation

### Problem Description

We consider a counting process over a fixed time interval $\( T = 1 \)$, where events (or “successes”) occur:
- independently of each other,
- uniformly in time,
- at a constant average rate $\( \lambda > 0 \)$.

The goal is to simulate this process and analyze the stochastic behavior that emerges.

---

### Discrete-Time Approximation

To approximate the continuous-time process, the interval $\( [0, T] \)$ is divided into $\( n \)$ small subintervals, each of length:

$$
\Delta t = \frac{T}{n}
$$

In each subinterval, an event occurs with probability:

$$
p = \frac{\lambda}{n}
$$

This produces a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials:
$$
X_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}\left(\frac{\lambda}{n}\right), \quad i = 1, \dots, n$$

The counting process is then defined as:

$$
N(t_k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} X_i, \quad t_k = \frac{k}{n}
$$

### Limiting Stochastic Process

As $\( n \to \infty \)$, the discrete-time process converges to a **Poisson process** with rate $\( \lambda \)$.

Specifically:

$$
N(t) \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda t)
$$
This is a fundamental result in probability theory and queueing theory.

### Theoretical Properties of the Poisson Process

A Poisson process $\( \{N(t)\}_{t \ge 0} \)$ satisfies the following properties:

- **Independent increments**  
  The number of events occurring in disjoint time intervals are independent.

- **Stationary increments**  
  The distribution of the number of events depends only on the length of the interval, not on its location.

- **Memoryless interarrival times**  
  The waiting times between successive events are independent and exponentially distributed:
  $$
  T_i \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda)
  $$

- **Initial condition**  
  $$
  N(0) = 0
  $$

### Interpretation of the Rate Parameter $\( \lambda \)$

The parameter $\( \lambda \)$ has a clear probabilistic interpretation:

- It represents the **expected number of events per unit time**.
- It controls the *average slope* of the counting process $\( N(t) \)$.
- For any $\( t \ge 0 \)$:
  $$
  \mathbb{E}[N(t)] = \lambda t, \quad \text{Var}(N(t)) = \lambda t
  $$

At $\( t = 1 \)$, both the mean and variance of the total number of events equal $\( \lambda \)$.

---

### Conclusion

By simulating a large number of Bernoulli trials with success probability $\( \lambda/n \)$, we obtain a discrete approximation of a Poisson arrival process. As the number of subintervals increases, the simulation converges to a continuous-time Poisson process, illustrating how memoryless jump processes naturally arise from simple probabilistic assumptions.

## Poisson Arrival / Jump Process — Simulation with Chart.js

The following simulation approximates a **Poisson process** on the time interval  
$\( T = 1 \)$ by dividing it into $\( n \)$ small subintervals and generating an event in each one with probability $\( \lambda / n \)$.

As $\( n \)$ increases, the resulting counting process converges to a Poisson process with rate $\( \lambda \)$.

### Interpretation of the Simulation

- Each small subinterval corresponds to a **Bernoulli trial** with probability $\( \lambda/n \)$.
- The process increases by discrete jumps of size 1.
- The stepwise shape reflects the **jump nature** of the Poisson process.
- Increasing $\( \lambda \)$ increases the frequency of jumps.
- Increasing $\( n \)$ improves the approximation to continuous time.

---

### Theoretical Connection

As $\( n \to \infty \)$:

$$
N(t) \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda t)
$$

The interarrival times converge to an **exponential distribution**, making the process **memoryless**.

This simulation visually demonstrates how a simple discrete Bernoulli scheme converges to a continuous-time stochastic process.
