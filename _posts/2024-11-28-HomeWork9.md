- **T1**: Mention the main properties of the sampling mean and variance.
Illustrate the law of large numbers and some possible applications, especially related to cybersecurity concepts.

Application / practice
Following the same scheme of HMWK 7 compute the distribution of the sampling variance ("corrected" or not).
Determine the distribution of the variances of the samples, and its mean and variance.
discussing the observed relationship with the mean and variance of the parent (theoretical) distribution.
