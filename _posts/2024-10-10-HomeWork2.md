## Research Topics: Theory (T)

- **T1**: Basic notions in Statistics: Population, Statistical Units, Distribution, Frequency (relative, absolute, percentage)
- **T2**: Notion of arithmetic average. Derivation. Computational problems with floating point representation (errors, catastrophic cancellation) and numerical solution (Knuth)


## Research Topics: Applications (A)

- **A1**: Find the simplest and most elegant way to show the Welford recursion.
(Winner will have prize ðŸ˜Š )


Application
2. Refine you Eulerâ€“Maruyama simulator to approximate numerical solution of a stochastic 
differential equation (SDE), buy adding the following variants to the existing framework:

A. Jumps -1 +1 with prob. p [random walk]
B. Absolute and relative frequency trajectories
C. Final distribution and intermediate distributions (at one internal
time/step selectable from the gui), with mean and variance.

(make it all parametric so that one unique interface will handle it all)

Research
Make your personal notes about the behavior of mean and variance wrt to time.
What did you observe in all the 4 different cases (relative/abs freq & Bernoulli/random walk) ?
