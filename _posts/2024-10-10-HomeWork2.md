## Research Topics: Theory (T)

- **T1**: Basic notions in Statistics: Population, Statistical Units, Distribution, Frequency (relative, absolute, percentage)
- **T2**: Notion of arithmetic average. Derivation. Computational problems with floating point representation (errors, catastrophic cancellation) and numerical solution (Knuth)


## Research Topics: Applications (A)

- **A1**: We have n servers with m attackers. The hacker has probability p to penetrate each server. Make a graphical representation (line flat if hacker doesnâ€™t penetrate and a jump to 1 if he penetrates), try different n, m, p. At time n we want to complete distribution how many reached each level. (Draw the distribution histogram vertically at the end of the chart, so that each rectangle representing the attackers' frequency is placed on the corresponding number of penetrations (or "successes") they achieved).
