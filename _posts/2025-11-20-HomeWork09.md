# 1. Interpretations of Probability

Probability has several classical interpretations that historically attempted to formalize uncertainty.

## 1.1 Classical Interpretation
Defines probability as:

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{favorable outcomes}}{\text{equally likely outcomes}}
$$

Works well for games of chance, but fails when outcomes are not equally likely.

## 1.2 Frequentist Interpretation
Probability is the *limiting frequency* of an event:

$$
P(A)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{N_n(A)}{n}
$$

Cannot assign probability to unique events.

## 1.3 Bayesian Interpretation
Probability is a "degree of belief", updated via Bayes' theorem:

$$
P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

Handles unique events but depends on priors.

## 1.4 Geometric Interpretation
Defines probability using geometric ratios (length/area/volume), used in continuum problems.

# 2. Axiomatic Approach and Resolution of Conflicts

Kolmogorov introduced three axioms:

1. **Non-negativity:** $\(P(A) \ge 0\)$  
2. **Normalization:** $\(P(\Omega)=1\)$  
3. **Countable additivity:** If $\(A_i\)$ are disjoint,  
   $$
   P\left(\bigcup_i A_i\right) = \sum_i P(A_i)
   $$

This approach:

- does **not** assume equally likely outcomes,  
- unifies frequentist and Bayesian interpretations,  
- supports continuous and infinite sample spaces,  
- provides a consistent mathematical foundation.

# 3. Probability and Measure Theory

Probability theory is a special case of measure theory.

## 3.1 σ-Algebra
A σ-algebra $\( \mathcal{F} \)$ satisfies:

- $\( \Omega \in \mathcal{F} \)$
- closed under complements
- closed under countable unions

## 3.2 Probability Measure
A function  
$$
P: \mathcal{F} \to [0,1]
$$  
satisfying Kolmogorov’s axioms.

## 3.3 Random Variables
A random variable is a measurable function:

$$
X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}
$$

such that $\( \{X \le x\} \in \mathcal{F} \)$.

# 4. Results Derived from the Axioms

## 4.1 Subadditivity

$$
P(A \cup B) \le P(A) + P(B)
$$

**Proof:**  
Write
$$
A \cup B = A \cup (B \setminus A)
$$
and use countable additivity.

## 4.2 Inclusion–Exclusion Principle

$$
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)
$$

Generalizes to three or more sets.

# 5. Simulation of a Counting Process

We simulate events occurring randomly over $\([0,1]\)$ with average rate $\( \lambda \)$.

Divide time into $\( n \)$ intervals, each with event probability $\( p=\lambda/n \)$.

As $\( n\to\infty \)$, this approximates a **Poisson process**.

        borderWidth: 1,
        fill: false
      }]
    }
  });
}
</script>

## 7. Interpretation of the Process

The simulation approximates a **Poisson counting process**.

### Poisson Distribution of the Counts
The number of events by time \( t \) is:

$$
N(t) \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda t)
$$

### Distribution of Interarrival Times
The waiting times between successive events are independent and follow an exponential distribution:

$$
T_i \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda)
$$

### Key Properties of the Poisson Process
- **Independent increments:**  
  The number of events in disjoint time intervals are independent.

- **Stationary increments:**  
  The distribution of increments depends only on the length of the interval, not on its position in time.

### Interpretation of the Rate Parameter $\( \lambda \)$
- Expected number of events per unit time.
- Controls the *steepness* of the counting curve $\( N(t) \)$.
- At time $\( t = 1 \)$,  
  $$
  \mathbb{E}[N(1)] = \lambda, \quad \text{Var}[N(1)] = \lambda.
  $$

## 8. Summary

- The various interpretations of probability (classical, frequentist, Bayesian, geometric) are harmonized by the **axiomatic approach**, which resolves conceptual inconsistencies.
- Measure theory provides a robust foundation for probability: σ-algebras define measurable events, probability measures assign probabilities, and random variables are measurable functions.
- Important results such as **subadditivity** and **inclusion–exclusion** follow directly from Kolmogorov’s axioms.
- A discrete Bernoulli process with success probability $\( \lambda/n \)$ in each of $\( n \)$ subintervals approximates a **Poisson process** as  
  $$
  n \to \infty.
  $$
