## Researches about pure theory (T)

T5. Illustrate the concept of conditional, joint, marginal (relative) frequency using a simple bivariate distribution
T6. Illustrate the concept of statistical independence and the resulting mathematical relationships between the above frequencies

## Researches about applications (A)

A5. Create a distribution from the data obtained by the sniffer Wireshark by reading the CSV file or realtime data generated by the program
[optional: create a bivariate distribution]

## Researches about theory relevant to applications (TA)

TA3. A survey on ONLINE algorithms (mean, variance, median, etc...)
TA4. Illustrate in particular, Knuth recursion for the computation of the arithmetic mean or average, discussion why it is preferable to the "naive" algo
