## Research Topics: Theory (T)
 
- **T1**: Illustrate formally, in the simplest possible way, why the Median is the minimum c f the sum of |x(i) - c| (sum of absolute deviations).

- **T2**: Find all possible different conceptual different ways to define a "location" statistics (sometime also called "center" or "central tendency") or synthesis of a distributions. Showing how the generalization of these ideas can potentially lead to infinite other definitions. 



## Research Topics: Applications (A)

- **A1**: Refine your SDE simulator to simulate a continuous time process where we can have an attack (indicated with a jump of +1) at any time with a constant rate of attack. To create the approximation of time continuity subdivide your reference temporal window into numerous intervals of vanishing size dt = 1/n and to each infinitesimal interval assign a probability of a +1 "jump" (attack success) equal to Lambda * dt, where Lambda is a simulation parameter, having the meaning of expected total number of attacks in the reference period.

# **T1: Why the Median Minimizes the Sum of Absolute Deviations**

To illustrate why the **median** minimizes the sum of absolute deviations $\( \sum |x_i - c| \)$, consider the following:

### 1. Absolute Deviation Function:
Given a set of values $\( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \)$, we want to minimize the function:

$$
S(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - c|
$$

Where $\( c \)$ is some central point (a statistic we want to find). Our goal is to show that this function is minimized when $\( c \)$ is the median.

### 2. Behavior of Absolute Deviations:
- **For values less than the median**: If $\( c \)$ is less than the median, increasing $\( c \)$ reduces the absolute deviations from values larger than $\( c \)$, but increases deviations from values smaller than $\( c \)$. However, the overall effect will reduce the sum until $\( c \)$ reaches the median.
  
- **For values greater than the median**: Similarly, if $\( c \)$ is greater than the median, decreasing $\( c \)$ will reduce the sum of deviations.

### 3. Median as Minimizer:
At $\( c = \text{Median}(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \)$, the sum of deviations is minimized because shifting $\( c \)$ either left or right would increase the sum of absolute deviations from other points. The key property of the median is that it balances the distances of data points above and below it.

In summary, the median splits the data into two halves, minimizing the sum of absolute deviations by balancing the number of points on either side.

# **T2: Different Conceptual Ways to Define "Location" (or Central Tendency)**

There are various ways to define the "location" or central tendency of a distribution. Each captures a different aspect of what we might consider "central" in a dataset:

### 1. **Mean (Arithmetic Average)**:
The most common measure, calculated as:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

- **Properties**: Sensitive to outliers, treats all values equally.
- **Generalization**: Can be generalized to weighted means or means that take into account variance.

### 2. **Median**:
The middle value when the data is sorted. Minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

- **Properties**: Robust to outliers, useful for skewed distributions.
- **Generalization**: Can be generalized into quantiles (e.g., quartiles, percentiles).

### 3. **Mode**:
The value that appears most frequently.

- **Properties**: Reflects the most common outcome, can be multiple modes for multimodal distributions.
- **Generalization**: Modes can be defined differently depending on the resolution of the dataset (e.g., modal class for grouped data).

### 4. **Geometric Mean**:
The nth root of the product of all values:

$$
\text{Geometric Mean} = \left( \prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right)^{1/n}
$$

- **Properties**: Useful for data that grows exponentially, such as rates of return.
- **Generalization**: Can be used to handle multiplicative processes.

### 5. **Harmonic Mean**:
Defined as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of reciprocals:
$$
\text{Harmonic Mean} = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x_i}}
$$
- **Properties**: Used when dealing with rates (e.g., speed, cost per unit).
- **Generalization**: Weighted harmonic means exist for more complex data.

### 6. **Trimmed Mean**:
An arithmetic mean after removing the highest and lowest k% of values.

- **Properties**: Reduces the effect of outliers without fully discarding data.

### 7. **Winsorized Mean**:
Similar to the trimmed mean, but instead of discarding outliers, extreme values are replaced with the nearest retained value.

### 8. **Midrange**:
The average of the minimum and maximum values:
$$
\text{Midrange} = \frac{\min(x) + \max(x)}{2}
$$
- **Properties**: Simple to calculate, but highly sensitive to outliers.

### 9. **Midhinge**:
The average of the first and third quartiles:
$$
\text{Midhinge} = \frac{Q_1 + Q_3}{2}
$$
- **Properties**: A robust measure that balances between the extremes.

### 10. **Generalized Mean (Power Mean)**:
A family of means that includes the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means:
$$
M_p(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^p \right)^{1/p}
$$
- **Properties**: Varies based on the power parameter \( p \).
- **Generalization**: Allows control over how extreme values affect the central measure.

### Infinite Generalization of Central Tendencies:

These examples show that central tendency can be generalized infinitely by defining a measure based on different principles:
- **Distance-based**: Median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.
- **Moment-based**: Mean minimizes the sum of squared deviations.
- **Order-based**: Quantiles and other measures that rely on sorted data.
- **Function-based**: Power mean, geometric mean, harmonic mean generalize based on underlying mathematical functions.

By changing the way we measure central tendency (e.g., changing the distance function or considering data differently), we can define infinitely many "central" statistics.
