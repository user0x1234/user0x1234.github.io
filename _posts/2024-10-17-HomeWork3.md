## Research Topics: Theory (T)
 
- **T1**: Illustrate formally, in the simplest possible way, why the Median is the minimum c f the sum of |x(i) - c| (sum of absolute deviations).

- **T2**: Find all possible different conceptual different ways to define a "location" statistics (sometime also called "center" or "central tendency") or synthesis of a distributions. Showing how the generalization of these ideas can potentially lead to infinite other definitions. 



## Research Topics: Applications (A)

- **A1**: Refine your SDE simulator to simulate a continuous time process where we can have an attack (indicated with a jump of +1) at any time with a constant rate of attack. To create the approximation of time continuity subdivide your reference temporal window into numerous intervals of vanishing size dt = 1/n and to each infinitesimal interval assign a probability of a +1 "jump" (attack success) equal to Lambda * dt, where Lambda is a simulation parameter, having the meaning of expected total number of attacks in the reference period.
