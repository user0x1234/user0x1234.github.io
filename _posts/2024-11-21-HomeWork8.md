Theory/Research

Recall the notion of Shannon Entropy amd other diversity measures of distributions

Recall the notion of primitive root (a primitive root modulo p a prime number is a number g such that for every
integer a that is coprime to p , there exists an integer k such that g^k \mod p = a )

Application / practice


Part 1
Find and compile a sufficiently large piece of text by selecting several web pages and create a letter frequency distribution.
Choose a random shift value (e.g., 1-25, with wrap-around) and apply the Caesar cipher to encrypt the original text:
E = L + shift for each letter L of the message.
Use frequency analysis or find any efficient and effective strategy to find the shift and decrypt the message.

Part 2 Optional (Modular exponentiation)
Convert each letter of the original text to a numeric representation (A = 0, B = 1, ..., Z = 25).
Choose Parameters: Choose an exponent e and a modulus P. Ensure that e and P are coprime
(for example, you might choose ( e = 3 ) and ( P = 37)).
Calculate Encoded Values: Calculate the encoded values using the formula: E = L^e mod P
for each letter L of the message, where Lis the numeric representation of the letter.

See if you can find strategies and effective ways to get back the values of e and P. (In practice, certain values of e, like 3 or 65537 are commonly used. You may start with these values for e)

Visualize the distributions and calculate the Shannon entropy of the transformed distributions.
Summarize the findings from both parts of the exercise. Discuss how statistical analysis enhances understanding
of cryptographic algorithms and the importance of these skills in cybersecurity.
