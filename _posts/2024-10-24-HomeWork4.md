## Research Topics: Theory (T)

- **T1**:  Illustrate the concept of statistical independence, showing also the analogies with the formal definitions in probability theory.


## Research Topics: Applications (A)

- **A1**: Refine your stochastic SDE simulator to generate a continuous time, process to represent the scaling limit of the random Walk. To create the approximation of time continuity subdivide your reference temporal window into vanishing intervals dt and on each infinitesimal interval assign a probability p or p to make a jump of a + or - sqrt(dt). Note the significance of the simulation (Donsker invariance principle/ theorem or the functional central limit theorem) in relation to the Wiener process.
