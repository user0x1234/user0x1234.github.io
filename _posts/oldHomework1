## Researches about theory (R)
1_R. Give your best description of the many reaching out of statistics, in its various form, as a branch of math (Probability theory, etc.), as a set of methodologies used in many other disciplines, as an essential tool to dela with any sort of data, make reports and provide governance tools. Discuss whether it can be considered a "science" and what is the "scientific method". What is the role of Statistics in math and science ?

## Applications / Practice (A)
1_A. Create - in both languages C# and VB.NET - a program which does the following simple tasks to get acquainted with the tool:
		- when a button is pressed some text appears in a richtexbox on the startup form
		- when another button is pressed animate one or more colored balls within a rectangle

# Statistics
Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.[1][2][3] In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.[4] 

Mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics. Mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure-theoretic probability theory.[5][6]

Mathematical statistics is the application of probability theory, a branch of mathematics, to statistics, as opposed to techniques for collecting statistical data. Specific mathematical techniques which are used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure theory.[7][8]

## Methods 

Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).[5] Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.

## What is the role of Statistics in math and science ?

Statistical methods can be used to summarize or describe a collection of data; this is called descriptive statistics.
In addition, patterns in the data may be modeled in a way that accounts for randomness and uncertainty in the observations, and then used to draw inferences about the process or population being studied; this is called inferential statistics.
Both descriptive and inferential statistics comprise applied statistics.
There is also a discipline called mathematical statistics, which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.

A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality, and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on response or dependent variables.
There are two major types of causal statistical studies, experimental studies and observational studies.

In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed.
The difference between the two types is in how the study is actually conducted.

## Nature of Statistics – Science

What is the nature of statistics? Is it a science or an art? This is a debatable topic. Let’s look at both.        

Science, by definition, is a systematic body of knowledge which studies the cause and effect relationship and endeavors to find out generalization. In simpler terms, it explains the facts. Further, the primary features of science are:

It is a systematic study of any subject
It takes a fact and tries to establish the relationship between cause and effect
Also, the laws of science are universal in nature

If we take the various statistical methods in consideration, we can define statistics as a science in which we study:

- Numerous methods of collecting, editing, classifying, tabulating and presenting facts using graphs and diagrams
- Several ways of condensing data regarding various social, political, and economic problems

This is done to establish a relationship between various facts. Also, it helps in analyzing and interpreting problems and forecast them too.

However, unlike the pure sciences like physics, chemistry, etc., statistics is not an exact science. We can call it a science of scientific methods. Statistics help other sciences to derive their own laws.

## (A) Applications / Practice
	
## Create the project Visual Basic Project

When you create an application in Visual Studio, you first create a project and a solution. For this example, you'll create a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) project.
 - Open Visual Studio.
 - On the Create a new project window, choose the Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) template for Visual Basic.

## Create the application

After you select your Visual Basic project template and name your file, Visual Studio opens a form for you. A form is a Windows user interface.

### Add a button to the form

-  Click Toolbox to open the Toolbox fly-out window.
-  Click the Button control and then drag it onto the form.
-  In the Appearance section (or the Fonts section) of the Properties window, type Click this, and then press Enter

### Add a richtextbox to the form

Now that we've added a button control to create an action, let's add a richtextbox control to send text to.

- Select the richtextbox control from the Toolbox window, and then drag it onto the form and drop it.
- In either the Design section or the (DataBindings) section of the Properties window, change the name of richTextForm1 to rTFHelloWorld, and then press Enter.

### Add code to the form

- In the Form1.vb [Design] window, double-click the Click this button to open the Form1.vb window. (Alternatively, you can expand Form1.vb in Solution Explorer, and then click Form1.)
- In the Form1.vb window, between the Private Sub and End Sub lines, type or enter richTextForm1.Text = "Hello World!" as shown in the following screenshot:

![button](/assets/insertTextInRich.PNG)

### Run the application

- Click the Start button to run the application.
- Click Start to debug and run the app
