# (T1) Basic Notions in Statistics

# 📊 Statistics and Its Usefulness in Cybersecurity

## What Is Statistics
**Statistics** is a branch of mathematics that deals with the **collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data**.  
In simple terms, it helps us understand and draw meaningful conclusions from large amounts of information.

---

## 🛡️ Why It’s Useful in Cybersecurity

Statistics plays a key role in **cybersecurity** because it helps professionals:
- Detect **anomalies** and suspicious behaviors,  
- Analyze **risks and threats**,  
- Make **data-driven decisions**.

---

### 🔍 1. Anomaly and Intrusion Detection
- Statistical models can define what “normal” network activity looks like.  
- When data significantly deviates from this baseline (e.g., a sudden spike in failed login attempts), it may indicate a **cyber attack**.  
- Techniques such as **mean**, **standard deviation**, and **regression analysis** are used to identify these outliers.

---

### 📊 2. Risk Assessment and Management
- By analyzing historical incident data, organizations can estimate the **probability and impact** of different security threats.  
- Statistical models help **quantify risk levels** and **prioritize responses** effectively.

---

### 🧩 3. Malware and Threat Analysis
- Statistics helps cybersecurity analysts cluster and classify malicious files based on measurable features (file size, code patterns, etc.).  
- **Bayesian** and other statistical classification methods can help **predict whether a file is malicious or benign**.

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ 4. User Behavior Analytics
- Statistical analysis can monitor user activities to detect **insider threats**.  
- For example, if an employee downloads a large amount of data at unusual times, this anomaly can be flagged for review.

---

### 📈 5. Performance and Trend Analysis
- Statistical summaries and visualizations (like histograms or time series plots) help identify **trends** over time — such as rising phishing attempts or recurring vulnerabilities.

---

## 💡 In Summary
> **Statistics** enables cybersecurity professionals to **turn raw data into actionable intelligence**.  
> It helps detect abnormal patterns, estimate risks, and support **evidence-based security decisions**.
