## Research Topics: Theory (T)

- **T1**: Basic notions in Statistics: Population, Statistical Units, Distribution, Frequency (relative, absolute, percentage)
- **T2**: Notion of arithmetic average. Derivation. Computational problems with floating point rapresentation (errors, catastrophical cancellation) and numerical solution (Knuth)


## Research Topics: Applications (A)

- **A1**: We have n servers with m attackers. The hacker has probability p to penetrate each server. Make a graphical representation (line flat if hacker doesnâ€™t penetrate and a jump to 1 if he penetrates), try different n,m,p. At time n we want to complete distribution how many reached each level. (Draw the distribution histogram vertically at the end of the chart, so that each rectangle representing the attackers' frequency is placed on the corresponding number of penetrations (or "successes") they achieved).

# (T1) Basic Notions in Statistics

## 1. Population

In statistics, a **population** refers to the entire set of individuals, objects, or data points that share common characteristics and are the subject of study. The population can be **finite** (a specific, countable number) or **infinite**.
m
- **Example of a finite population**: All students in a university.
- **Example of an infinite population**: The possible outcomes of rolling a fair die infinitely.

### Sample vs. Population
A **sample** is a subset of the population, selected to represent the population as a whole. When we analyze data, we often use samples because it is impractical to study the entire population.

## 2. Statistical Units

A **statistical unit** (also called an **observation** or **element**) is an individual member of the population that provides a single piece of data. Each unit is the basic element used in the statistical analysis.

- **Example of statistical units**: 
    - In a survey of 100 households, each household is a statistical unit.
    - In a study of 50 test scores, each test score is a statistical unit.

### Characteristics of Statistical Units:
1. **Homogeneity**: All units should belong to the same population.
2. **Independence**: Each unit should be independent of the others.
3. **Measurability**: Each unit should provide measurable data.

## 3. Distribution

**Distribution** refers to the way data values are spread across different categories or intervals. It shows the frequency of various outcomes in a dataset.

A **probability distribution** describes how the probability of each outcome is distributed across all possible outcomes. For a dataset, a **frequency distribution** indicates how often each value (or range of values) occurs.

### Types of Distributions:
- **Normal distribution**: A symmetric, bell-shaped curve where most values cluster around the mean.
- **Uniform distribution**: All values have the same frequency.
- **Skewed distribution**: Values are not symmetrically distributed; can be left-skewed or right-skewed.

---

## 4. Frequency

In statistics, **frequency** refers to the number of times a particular value or outcome occurs in a dataset.

### 4.1 Absolute Frequency
The **absolute frequency** of a value is the number of times that value appears in the dataset. It is the count of occurrences.

- **Example**: In the dataset `{2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5}`, the absolute frequency of:
    - 2 is 2,
    - 3 is 1,
    - 5 is 3.

### 4.2 Relative Frequency
The **relative frequency** is the proportion of times a value occurs, expressed as a fraction or decimal. It is the absolute frequency divided by the total number of observations.

$\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Absolute Frequency}}{\text{Total Number of Observations}}$

- **Example**: If the total number of observations is 6, the relative frequency of 5 (which occurs 3 times) is:

$
\frac{3}{6} = 0.5
$

### 4.3 Percentage Frequency
The **percentage frequency** expresses the relative frequency as a percentage:

$\text{Percentage Frequency} = \text{Relative Frequency} \times 100$

- **Example**: In the same dataset, the percentage frequency of 5 is:

$0.5 \times 100 = 50\%$

---

### Summary of Frequencies:
- **Absolute Frequency**: Number of occurrences of a value.
- **Relative Frequency**: Proportion of occurrences of a value.
- **Percentage Frequency**: Relative frequency expressed as a percentage.

# (T2) Arithmetic Average, Floating-Point Errors, and Numerical Solutions

## 1. Arithmetic Average

The **arithmetic average** (also called the **mean**) is a measure of central tendency that represents the typical value in a set of numbers. It is defined as the sum of all the numbers in the dataset divided by the total number of elements.

### Derivation
Given a set of $\( n \)$ numbers $\( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \)$, the arithmetic average $\( \bar{x} \)$ is defined as:

$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$

Where:
- $\( x_i \)$ is the $\( i \)$-th element of the dataset.
- $\( n \)$ is the number of elements in the dataset.
  
For example, for the set \( \{2, 3, 5\} \):

$\bar{x} = \frac{2 + 3 + 5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} = 3.33$


## 2. Computational Problems with Floating-Point Representation

In practice, calculating the arithmetic average can encounter **floating-point representation** issues due to the limitations of storing real numbers on computers. **Floating-point** numbers are a finite approximation of real numbers, which leads to errors in both precision and accuracy. 

### Key Problems:

### 2.1 Floating-Point Precision

Real numbers are typically represented using **IEEE 754** floating-point standards, which have limited precision. As a result, not all real numbers can be represented exactly. This introduces **rounding errors** that accumulate when performing multiple operations like summation.

- For instance, summing numbers with vastly different magnitudes (e.g., $\( 10^{8} + 10^{-8} \)$) can lead to loss of precision because the smaller number gets "absorbed" by the larger one in floating-point arithmetic.

### 2.2 Catastrophic Cancellation

This occurs when subtracting two nearly equal floating-point numbers. The result can be a large relative error because the significant digits cancel out, leaving only the imprecise lower-order digits.

For example, subtracting two nearly equal numbers:

$(1.0000001 - 1.0000000)$

In floating-point arithmetic, this might produce an inaccurately small result due to rounding issues.

### Example of Error:
Consider adding a series of numbers like \( 10^8, 1, -10^8 \). Ideally, the sum should be \( 1 \), but floating-point rounding issues may result in **0** due to cancellation of significant digits in intermediate steps:

$(10^8 + 1) - 10^8 \quad \text{in floating-point representation} \approx 10^8 - 10^8 = 0$

Thus, the correct value of $\( 1 \)$ is lost.

### 3. Numerical Solutions: Knuth's Kahan Summation Algorithm

To reduce floating-point errors in summations, **Kahan's Summation Algorithm** (also known as **compensated summation**) can be used. It improves the precision of the sum by keeping track of small errors that would otherwise be lost.

#### Algorithm:

```pseudo
function kahanSum(input):
    sum = 0.0
    compensation = 0.0   // A running compensation for lost low-order bits.
    
    for i = 0 to length(input) - 1:
        y = input[i] - compensation  // Subtract compensation to correct small errors
        temp = sum + y               // Add the corrected value to the sum
        compensation = (temp - sum) - y  // Compute the new compensation
        sum = temp                   // Update the sum
    
    return sum

```
