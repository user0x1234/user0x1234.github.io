# **T1** Sampling Mean and Variance: General Concepts and Features

## Sampling Mean

### Definition
The **sampling mean** is the average value calculated from a random sample of observations drawn from a population.

For a sample $\( \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \)$ of size $\( n \)$, the sampling mean is defined as:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
$$

### Properties
1. **Unbiasedness**: 
   The expected value of the sampling mean $\( \mathbb{E}[\bar{x}] \)$ is equal to the population mean $\( \mu \)$:
   $$
   \mathbb{E}[\bar{x}] = \mu
   $$

2. **Variance of the Sampling Mean**: 
   The variance of the sampling mean is inversely proportional to the sample size $\( n \)$:
   $$
   \text{Var}(\bar{x}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
   $$
   where $\( \sigma^2 \)$ is the population variance.

3. **Normality (Central Limit Theorem)**:
   As $\( n \)$ increases, the distribution of $\( \bar{x} \)$ approaches a normal distribution, even if the population itself is not normally distributed.

## Sampling Variance

### Definition
The **sampling variance** measures the spread of the sample data. For a sample of size $\( n \)$, it is defined as:

$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

This is referred to as the **corrected variance**, where the denominator is $\( n-1 \)$ to account for bias in small samples.

### Properties
1. **Unbiasedness**:
   The sampling variance $\( s^2 \)$ is an unbiased estimator of the population variance $\( \sigma^2 \)$:
   $$
   \mathbb{E}[s^2] = \sigma^2
   $$

2. **Distribution**:
   - For a normally distributed population, the sampling variance follows a scaled chi-squared distribution:
     $$
     \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-1}
     $$

3. **Variance of the Sampling Variance**:
   The variability of $\( s^2 \)$ decreases as the sample size $\( n \)$ increases.

## Features of Distributions

### Distribution of the Sampling Mean
- **Shape**: Approximately normal (by the Central Limit Theorem) if $\( n \)$ is large enough.
- **Mean**: Equal to the population mean $\( \mu \)$.
- **Variance**: Scaled by sample size $\( n \)$, smaller than the population variance.

### Distribution of the Sampling Variance
- **Shape**: Right-skewed for small $\( n \)$, approaching normality for large $\( n \)$.
- **Mean**: Equal to the population variance $\( \sigma^2 \)$.
- **Variance**: Depends on both the sample size and the population variance.

---

## Applications in Statistics
1. **Confidence Intervals**:
   - The sampling mean is used to construct confidence intervals for the population mean.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Tests like $\( t \)$-tests rely on the sampling mean and variance.

3. **Data Modeling**:
   - Understanding the properties of sampling distributions is crucial for predictive models and simulations.

## Practical Note on Cybersecurity
In cybersecurity, sampling mean and variance are applied to:
- **Anomaly Detection**: Calculate mean and variance for network metrics to identify unusual behavior.
- **Threat Modeling**: Simulate distributions of attack frequencies or durations to estimate risk.
- **Performance Analysis**: Monitor system performance over time using statistical measures.




# **T2** General Idea of Lebesgue–Stieltjes Integration

## Overview

The **Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral** generalizes the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals. It allows integration with respect to a function (called a **weight function**) instead of the standard measure like length or area. This approach is widely used in probability theory and measure theory due to its flexibility in handling distributions and irregular measures.

---

## Formal Definition

Let $\( F \)$ be a function of bounded variation on $\( [a, b] \)$, meaning $\( F \)$ can increase, decrease, or remain constant, but its total variation is finite. The **Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral** integrates a function $\( f \)$ over $\( [a, b] \)$ with respect to $\( F \)$. 

The integral is written as:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dF(x)
$$

### Key Points:
1. If $\( F(x) = x \)$, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral reduces to the standard Riemann or Lebesgue integral.
2. If $\( F(x) \)$ is a step function, the integral sums $\( f(x) \)$ weighted by the size of the jumps of $\( F(x) \)$.

---

## Applications in Probability Theory

### 1. **Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)**:
   - The CDF $\( F(x) \)$ of a random variable defines the probability $\( P(X \leq x) \)$.
   - The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is used to compute the expectation of a random variable $\( X \)$ with respect to its CDF:
     $$
     \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, dF(x)
     $$

### 2. **Discrete and Continuous Random Variables**:
   - For **discrete** random variables, $\( F(x) \)$ is a step function, and the integral becomes a sum:
     $$
     \mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i} x_i P(X = x_i)
     $$
   - For **continuous** random variables, $\( F(x) \)$ is differentiable, and the integral simplifies to:
     $$
     \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f(x) \, dx
     $$
     where $\( f(x) = F'(x) \)$ is the probability density function (PDF).

### 3. **Change of Measure**:
   - Used in advanced topics like stochastic processes and finance, where the probability measure is transformed using Radon–Nikodym derivatives.

---

## Applications in Measure Theory

### 1. **Generalization of Measures**:
   - The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral provides a way to define integration with respect to general measures beyond length and area. 
   - For example, it supports measures that account for weights or densities concentrated on specific sets.

### 2. **Integration with Respect to Non-Standard Measures**:
   - Useful for integrating functions where the standard Lebesgue measure does not apply, such as fractal measures or singular distributions.

### 3. **Connection to Signed Measures**:
   - The function $\( F \)$ can represent signed measures, allowing for the integration over distributions with negative weights.

---

## Advantages of Lebesgue–Stieltjes Integration

1. **Flexibility**:
   - Handles integration with respect to functions that may not be smooth or continuous.

2. **Unification**:
   - Combines discrete and continuous integration into a single framework.

3. **Foundation for Probability and Stochastic Processes**:
   - Provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for random variables, expectations, and related concepts.

## Example in Probability Theory

### Problem: Expected Value of a Random Variable
Given a random variable $\( X \)$ with cumulative distribution function $\( F(x) \)$, compute the expected value $\( \mathbb{E}[X] \)$.

**Solution**:
$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, dF(x)
$$

- If $\( F(x) \)$ is stepwise (discrete variable):
  $$
  \mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_i x_i P(X = x_i)
  $$
- If $\( F(x) \)$ is differentiable (continuous variable):
  $$
  \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f(x) \, dx
  $$

---

## Example in Measure Theory

### Problem: Integrate with Respect to a Weighted Measure
Suppose $\( F(x) \)$ represents a measure that assigns weights to certain intervals. Compute the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral for $\( f(x) = x^2 \)$ over $\( [0, 1] \)$.

**Solution**:
$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dF(x)
$$
- This integrates $\( x^2 \)$ with respect to the weights defined by $\( F(x) \)$.

---

## Summary

The **Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral** bridges the gap between integration and measure theory, allowing for flexible handling of distributions, random variables, and generalized measures. Its applications in probability theory make it indispensable for understanding expectations, variances, and stochastic processes.
