## Research Topics: Theory (T)

- **T1**: Explain the concept of dataset and distribution, using a dbms create a sample dataset compute the k univariate distribution k<=3

## Research Topics: Applications (A)
- **A1**: take a text and compute the distribution of the letters, apply a caesar cypher, decode the encrypted text (assuming now the you dont nown the shift), decode using language distribution

# Caesar Cipher Analysis and Decoding via Frequency Distribution (JavaScript)

This example demonstrates how to:
1. Compute the letter frequency distribution of a given text  
2. Encrypt it using a Caesar cipher  
3. Automatically decode it *without knowing the shift*, using English language frequency statistics
