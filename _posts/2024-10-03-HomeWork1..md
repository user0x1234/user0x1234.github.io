### 1. Population
- **Definition**: A **population** in statistics refers to the complete set of items, individuals, or observations that share at least one common characteristic. It can include people, objects, events, or data points that are being studied.
  - **Example**: If you're studying the heights of students in a school, the population would be *all* the students in that school.

- **Types of Population**:
  - **Finite population**: Contains a limited number of observations or items.
  - **Infinite population**: Not countable or practically infinite, like all possible outcomes of rolling a die.

- **Census**: When data is collected from *every* member of a population, it's called a **census**.

### 2. Statistical Units (Units of Analysis)
- **Definition**: A **statistical unit** is an individual member or entity of a population that provides a data point for analysis.
  - **Example**: In a study on family income, each family surveyed is a statistical unit.

- **Key Types**:
  - **Individual**: A single person (e
