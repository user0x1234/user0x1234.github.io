## Researches about theory (T)

T1. What is Statistics<br />
T2. What is a Dataset? From the statistical units to the dataset variables and observed values<br />
T3. Find and list interesting applications of Statistics in Cybersecurity.<br />

## Researches about applications (A)

A1. Create a simple applications in C# and VB.NET to play with handlers and to understand sintax differences betweeen the two languages 

## Researches about theory relevant to applications (TA) 

TA1. Main differences between C# and VB.NET (handlers, case sensitivity, delimitators, brackets, arrays, generic classes, etc.)

## 1. Population
- **Definition**: The population in statistics refers to the complete set of items, individuals, or observations that share at least one common characteristic. It can include people, objects, events, or data points that are being studied.
  - **Example**: If you are studying the heights of students in a school, the population would be *all* the students in that school.
  
- **Types of Population**:
  - **Finite population**: A population that contains a limited number of observations or items.
  - **Infinite population**: A population that is not countable or practically infinite, like the set of all possible rolls of a die.

- **Census**: When you collect data from *every* member of a population, this is called a **census**.

## 2. Statistical Units (Units of Analysis)
- **Definition**: A **statistical unit** (or unit of observation) is an individual member or entity of a population that provides the data point for analysis.
  - **Example**: In a study on family income, each family surveyed would be a statistical unit.

- **Key Types**:
  - **Individual**: When the unit is a single person (e.g., students in a school).
  - **Group**: When the unit is a group (e.g., households, schools).
  - **Object or Item**: It could be objects like products or animals in the study.
  - **Event**: Units can also be events like days, transactions, or accidents.

- **Sample**: A **sample** is a subset of the population consisting of statistical units selected for measurement. A sample helps generalize the findings to the population.

## 3. Distribution
- **Definition**: A **distribution** in statistics describes how the values of a variable or a set of data points are spread or arranged.
  - **Example**: If you measure the test scores of students, the distribution would show how those scores are spread across different values (e.g., some scores are common, some rare).

- **Key Types of Distributions**:
  - **Probability distribution**: Shows the likelihood of each outcome in a population. Examples include the **normal distribution**, **binomial distribution**, and **Poisson distribution**.
  - **Frequency distribution**: It is an organized summary of data showing the number (or frequency) of observations within certain ranges.
  - **Empirical distribution**: Derived from actual data collected from a sample.

- **Shape of Distribution**:
  - **Normal distribution**: Bell-shaped curve, symmetric about the mean.
  - **Skewed distribution**: Asymmetric, with a tail on one side (left or right).
  - **Uniform distribution**: All outcomes are equally likely.
