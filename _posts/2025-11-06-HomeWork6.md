Analytical Task
Derive the simplest proofs for the recurrence relationships of the arithmetic mean and variance. Implement and test the corresponding online algorithms, which update statistics incrementally as new data becomes available. Traditional "batch" algorithms should not be used, as they are computationally less efficient, more memory-intensive, and prone to numerical instability (e.g., error propagation, catastrophic cancellation, and overflow).

Optional Discussion
From a numerical analysis and computational perspective, discuss the advantages of online algorithms in terms of numerical stability, error propagation, catastrophic cancellation, and overflow management. You may also comment on their computational efficiency, robustness, and scalability, comparing them with traditional batch algorithms.
