## What’s the difference between relative frequency and probability?

Probability is the relative frequency over an infinite number of trials.

For example, the probability of a coin landing on heads is .5, meaning that if you flip the coin an infinite number of times, it will land on heads half the time.

Since doing something an infinite number of times is impossible, relative frequency is often used as an estimate of probability. If you flip a coin 1000 times and get 507 heads, the relative frequency, .507, is a good estimate of the probability.


## Probability measure Space

In probability theory, a probability space or a probability triple ( Ω , F , P ) (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P) is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process or "experiment". For example, one can define a probability space which models the throwing of a die.

A probability space consists of three elements:[1][2]

    A sample space, Ω \Omega , which is the set of all possible outcomes.
    An event space, which is a set of events F {\mathcal {F}}, an event being a set of outcomes in the sample space.
    A probability function, which assigns each event in the event space a probability, which is a number between 0 and 1.
