## What’s the difference between relative frequency and probability?

Probability is the relative frequency over an infinite number of trials.

For example, the probability of a coin landing on heads is .5, meaning that if you flip the coin an infinite number of times, it will land on heads half the time.

Since doing something an infinite number of times is impossible, relative frequency is often used as an estimate of probability. If you flip a coin 1000 times and get 507 heads, the relative frequency, .507, is a good estimate of the probability.


## Probability measure Space

In probability theory, a probability space or a probability triple ( Ω , F , P )  is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process or "experiment". For example, one can define a probability space which models the throwing of a die.

A probability space consists of three elements:[1][2]

  1.  A sample space, Ω, which is the set of all possible outcomes.
  2.  An event space, which is a set of events F, an event being a set of outcomes in the sample space.
  3.  A probability function, which assigns each event in the event space a probability, which is a number between 0 and 1.

  In the example of the throw of a standard die, we would take the sample space to be { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 } . For the event space, we could simply use the set of all subsets of the sample space, which would then contain simple events such as { 5 } ("the die lands on 5"), as well as complex events such as { 2 , 4 , 6 }  ("the die lands on an even number"). Finally, for the probability function, we would map each event to the number of outcomes in that event divided by 6 — so for example, { 5 } would be mapped to 1 / 6 1/6, and { 2 , 4 , 6 }  would be mapped to 3 / 6 = 1 / 2 .

GDI+ is the portion of the Windows operating system that provides two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography. GDI+ improves on GDI (the Graphics Device Interface included with earlier versions of Windows) by adding new features and by optimizing existing features.<br />
<br />

The GDI+ managed class interface (a set of wrappers) is part of the .NET Framework, an environment for building, deploying, and running XML Web services and other applications.<br />
<br />
A bitmap is a matrix of bits that specifies the color of each pixel in a rectangular matrix of pixels. The number of bits it dedicates to a single pixel determines the number of colors that can be assigned to that pixel. For example, if each pixel is represented by 4 bits, a given pixel can be assigned one of 16 different colors (2 ^ 4 = 16)

## How to get device coordinates from world coordinates  

GDI+ uses three coordinate spaces: world, page, and device. <br />
World coordinates are the coordinates used to model a particular graphic world and are the coordinates you pass to methods in the .NET Framework. 
Page coordinates refer to the coordinate system used by a drawing surface, such as a form or control. Device coordinates are the coordinates used by the physical device being drawn on, such as a screen or sheet of paper. When you make the call myGraphics.DrawLine(myPen, 0, 0, 160, 80), the points that you pass to the DrawLine method—(0, 0) and (160, 80)—are in the world coordinate space. <br />
<br />
Before GDI+ can draw the line on the screen, the coordinates pass through a sequence of transformations. One transformation, called the world transformation, converts world coordinates to page coordinates, and another transformation, called the page transformation, converts page coordinates to device coordinates.
