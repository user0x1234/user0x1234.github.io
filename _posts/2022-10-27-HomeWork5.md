A8. Given an arbitrary rectangle and a distribution, create the corresponding histogram or column chart, with both vertical and horizontal orientation<br />
A9. Given a rectangle, enable its movement/resize/zoom using a mouse (this will be the resizable where we will draw alll future charts) <br />

## Arithmetic mean
In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean or arithmetic average, or just the mean or the average (when the context is clear), is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.[1]<br />
<br />
Given a data set *X = { x<sub>1</sub> , … , x<sub>n</sub> }*, the arithmetic mean (or mean or average), denoted x ¯ (read x bar), is the mean of the n n values *x<sub>1</sub> , x<sub>2</sub>, … , x<sub>n</sub>*.[2]

The arithmetic mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in a data set. In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency. The arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation, divided by the total number of observations. Symbolically, if we have a data set consisting of the values *a<sub>1</sub> , a<sub>2</sub>, … , a<sub>n</sub>*, then the arithmetic mean  *A* is defined by the formula:

## Average

In ordinary language, an average is a single number taken as representative of a list of numbers, usually the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are in the list (the arithmetic mean). For example, the average of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 (summing to 25) is 5. Depending on the context, an average might be another statistic such as the median, or mode. For example, the average personal income is often given as the median the number below which are 50% of personal incomes and above which are 50% of personal incomes because the mean would be misleadingly high by including personal incomes from a few billionaires

## Mathematical convergence

In mathematics, a series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence of numbers. More precisely, an infinite sequence *( a<sub>0</sub> , a<sub>1</sub> , a<sub>2</sub> , … )*  defines a series *S* that is denoted

The *nth* partial sum *S<sub>n</sub>* is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence; that is,

<img src="/assets/HomeWork5/cMaths2.PNG" alt="drawing" height="50"/>
 
A series is convergent (or converges) if the sequence *( S<sub>1</sub> , S<sub>2</sub> , S<sub>3</sub> , … )*  of its partial sums tends to a limit; that means that, when adding one *a<sub>k</sub>* after the other in the order given by the indices, one gets partial sums that become closer and closer to a given number. More precisely, a series converges, if there exists a number ℓ  such that for every arbitrarily small positive number *ε*, there is a (sufficiently large) integer *N*  such that for all *n ≥ N* ,

If the series is convergent, the (necessarily unique) number *ℓ*  is called the sum of the series. 
 

## Convergence in probability

The basic idea behind this type of convergence is that the probability of an “unusual” outcome becomes smaller and smaller as the sequence progresses.

The concept of convergence in probability is used very often in statistics. For example, an estimator is called consistent if it converges in probability to the quantity being estimated. Convergence in probability is also the type of convergence established by the weak law of large numbers.

### Definition

*A* sequence *{X<sub>n</sub>}* of random variables converges in probability towards the random variable *X* if for all *ε > 0*

## Differences between Inferential and Descriptive statistics.

Descriptive statistics :

*Descriptive Statistics refers to the set of procedures and methods used to summarize and organize a set of observations.*

*Descriptive statistics gives numerical and graphical procedures to summarize a collection of data in a clear and understandable way.*

Inferential statistic :

*Inferential Statistics refers to procedures and methods that allow researchers to infer or generalize observations made with samples to the larger population they were selected.*
*Inferential statistics provides procedures to draw inferences about a population from a sample.*
