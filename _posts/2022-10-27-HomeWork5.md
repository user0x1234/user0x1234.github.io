## Researches about pure theory (T)
T10. Explain all possible derivation of the arithmetic mean and in general of the other common types of averages<br />
T11. Illustrate the difference between "mathematical convergence" and "convergence" in probability<br />
T12. Illustrate the differences between Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics and the role of probability and probability distributions <br />
## Researches about applications (A)

A8. Given an arbitrary rectangle and a distribution, create the corresponding histogram or column chart, with both vertical and horizontal orientation<br />
A9. Given a rectangle, enable its movement/resize/zoom using a mouse (this will be the resizable where we will draw alll future charts) <br />

## Arithmetic mean
In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean or arithmetic average, or just the mean or the average (when the context is clear), is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.[1]<br />
<br />
Given a data set *X = { x<sub>1</sub> , … , x<sub>n</sub> }*, the arithmetic mean (or mean or average), denoted x ¯ (read x x bar), is the mean of the n n values *x<sub>1</sub> , x<sub>2</sub>, … , x<sub>n</sub>*.[2]

The arithmetic mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in a data set. In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency. The arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation, divided by the total number of observations. Symbolically, if we have a data set consisting of the values *a<sub>1</sub> , a<sub>2</sub>, … , a<sub>n</sub>*, then the arithmetic mean A A is defined by the formula:

## Average

In ordinary language, an average is a single number taken as representative of a list of numbers, usually the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are in the list (the arithmetic mean). For example, the average of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 (summing to 25) is 5. Depending on the context, an average might be another statistic such as the median, or mode. For example, the average personal income is often given as the median—the number below which are 50% of personal incomes and above which are 50% of personal incomes—because the mean would be misleadingly high by including personal incomes from a few billionaires


## Differences between Inferential and Descriptive statistics.

Descriptive statistics :

    Descriptive Statistics refers to the set of procedures and methods used to summarize and organize a set of observations.
    Descriptive statistics gives numerical and graphical procedures to summarize a collection of data in a clear and understandable way.

Inferential statistic :

    Inferential Statistics refers to procedures and methods that allow researchers to infer or generalize observations made with samples to the larger population they were selected.
    Inferential statistics provides procedures to draw inferences about a population from a sample.
