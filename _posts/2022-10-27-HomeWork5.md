# Researches about pure theory (T)
T10. Explain all possible derivation of the arithmetic mean and in general of the other common types of averages<br />
T11. Illustrate the difference between "mathematical convergence" and "convergence" in probability<br />
T12. Illustrate the differences between Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics and the role of probability and probability distributions <br />
## Researches about applications (A)

A8. Given an arbitrary rectangle and a distribution, create the corresponding histogram or column chart, with both vertical and horizontal orientation<br />
A9. Given a rectangle, enable its movement/resize/zoom using a mouse (this will be the resizable where we will draw alll future charts) <br />
