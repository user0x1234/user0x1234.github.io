## Research Topics: Theory (T)

- **T1**: Recall the fundamental theorem of calculus and demonstrate its relationship with density 
functions and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).

## Research Topics: Applications (A)
Exercise: Generate realizations from a discrete univariate probability distribution with arbitrary probabilities.
Graphically show the convergence of the empirical distribution to the theoretical distribution as the sample size increases.
Compute also, during the generation, the mean and variance using recursive methods (e.g., Knuth's/Welford's algorithms) 
and compare these results with the theoretical mean and variance, discussing the relationship.




# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Its Application to CDFs and PDFs

The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)** connects the concepts of integration and differentiation. In probability theory, it has a particularly useful application in linking **cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)** and **probability density functions (PDFs)**.

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)

The FTC is divided into two main parts:

1. **Part 1**: If $\( F \)$ is an antiderivative of $\( f \)$ on an interval $\( [a, b] \)$, then:
   
   $$
   \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
   $$

2. **Part 2**: If $\( f \)$ is continuous on $\( [a, b] \)$, then:
   
   $$
   \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_a^x f(t) \, dt \right) = f(x)
   $$

## Applying the FTC to CDF and PDF in Probability Theory

In probability theory:

- The **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** of a continuous random variable $\( X \)$, denoted by $\( F(x) \)$, gives the probability that $\( X \)$ is less than or equal to $\( x \)$:
  
  $$
  F(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(t) \, dt
  $$
  where $\( f(x) \)$ is the **Probability Density Function (PDF)**.

- By the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**, we can derive the PDF from the CDF.

### Deriving the PDF from the CDF

Using Part 2 of the FTC:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} F(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_{-\infty}^x f(t) \, dt \right) = f(x)
$$

This implies that the PDF $\( f(x) \)$ is simply the derivative of the CDF $\( F(x) \)$:
$$
f(x) = F'(x)
$$

## Intuitive Explanation

The PDF $\( f(x) \)$ represents the rate at which the probability accumulates at a particular point $\( x \)$. On the other hand, the CDF $\( F(x) \)$ shows the total probability accumulated from $\( -\infty \)$ to $\( x \)$.

Thus:

- $\( F(x) \)$ gives the probability that the random variable $\( X \)$ will be less than or equal to $\( x \)$.
- $\( f(x) \)$ provides the "density" of this probability at each point, describing how quickly the probability is changing around $\( x \)$.

In summary:

1. The **CDF** $\( F(x) \)$ is an integral of the **PDF** $\( f(x) \)$ from $\( -\infty \)$ to $\( x \)$, capturing the cumulative probability.
2. The **PDF** $\( f(x) \)$ is the derivative of the **CDF** $\( F(x) \)$, indicating the density of probability at each point.
